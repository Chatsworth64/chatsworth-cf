## What happens in a hypnotherapy session

There are different types of hypnotherapy, and different ways of hypnotising someone.

First, you'll usually have a talk with your therapist to discuss what you hope to achieve and agree what methods your therapist will use.

After this, the hypnotherapist may:

* lead you into a deeply relaxed state – most people feel refreshed and relaxed
* use your agreed methods to help you towards your goals – for example, suggesting that you do not want to carry out a certain habit
* gradually bring you out of the trance-like state. Most people feel refreshed and relaxed
* You're fully in control when under hypnosis and do not have to take on the therapist's suggestions if you do not want to.

If necessary, you can bring yourself out of the hypnotic state.

Hypnosis does not work if you do not want to be hypnotised.
